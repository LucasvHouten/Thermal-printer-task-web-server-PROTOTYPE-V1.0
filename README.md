NOTE:
-  This program is meant to run on a ubuntu based, local webserver(in my case a Raspberri pi with ubuntu server).
-  It should also work fine on a ubuntu based computer system.
-  THIS IS A VERSION FOR TESTING, NOT A FUNCTIONAL PROGRAM(yet)!

This program connects to cheap chinese mini bluetooth printers and transforms them into productivity/task management machines.
User can input task via web based ui and change time values, like print time, break time and reminder interval time.
